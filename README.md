## FAQ

### The Google Maps API key isn't working

You might have hit a limit with the API key â€” if this is the case you need to sign up for your own API key over at <https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/usage>.
You will need to enable static maps for your API key.

Once you have the API key, simply place it in your `variables.env` file and restart.

### Four Square API Quota Exceeded!

This application runs using basic version of FourSquare API for developers, which restricts the number of premium calls.
If you encounter this error, Create a new set of CLIENT_ID & CLIENT_SECRET keys from Foursquare and try again.
